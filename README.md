# GitHub Repo Tracker

## Installation and Usage
### Installation
 - Clone or download this repo
 - In the terminal, navigate to the `github_repositories` folder

## Wins and Challenges
### Wins
 - We have a fully functioning app that meets all requirements of the project brief
 - All respositories for an entered user are retrieved
 - The app is styled to look like the GitHub repositories page

### Challenges
 - Fixing the form so that it stops multiple submissions from happening once the submit button has been clicked (until the next desired name is entered).
